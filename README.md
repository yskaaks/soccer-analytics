## Usage

This section details the steps to analyze a soccer game video using the Soccer Players Analysis System. The process involves setting color filters for team segmentation, running the analysis, and reviewing the outputs, including heatmaps for both teams.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project's Source Directory

Open a terminal window and navigate to the source directory of the project:

```bash
cd soccer-players-analysis/Usage/soccer-analytics/src
```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis Script

Execute the `main.py` script with the `--input_video_path` argument pointing to the absolute path of your desired video file. This ensures the script correctly locates and processes the video:

```bash
python main.py --input_video_path "path/to/desired/video.mp4"
```

Replace `"path/to/desired/video.mp4"` with the actual path to your video.

### Step 3: Set HSV Color Filters for Team Segmentation

Upon running the script, a window will appear displaying two sample frames from the video (the first and middle frames) alongside sliders for manually setting the min and max HSV values to create custom filters for each team's colors.

#### 3.1 Segment Team 1

Adjust the sliders to accurately segment the jerseys of one team, which will be assigned as Team 1. Once satisfied with the segmentation, press the `y` key to save the color range.
